# Vincent-s-Eagle-Project
My project involves building a bench and multiple owl houses for St. Barts to support the community and provide safe nesting spots for local wildlife. There will be a lot of woodworking and assembly, so if you have gloves, eye protection, or a power drill, please bring them along.
